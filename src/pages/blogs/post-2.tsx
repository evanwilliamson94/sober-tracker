        Building a sober community is one of the most powerful tools for staying sober. It offers accountability, support, and a sense of belonging. Hereâ€™s how to create a strong network that will help you stay on track.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Join a Local Support Group</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Find a local AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) or NA (Narcotics Anonymous) group to connect with others who understand the challenges of addiction. Regular meetings provide a space for sharing and encouragement.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Use Online Communities</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        In addition to local groups, online communities offer support and connection with people from around the world. Join Facebook groups, Reddit threads, or specialized sober apps to stay connected.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Reach Out to Sober Friends</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        If you have friends who are also on a sobriety journey, connect with them regularly. Sober friends understand the challenges you face and can provide both advice and emotional support.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg mb-4">By building a community of support, you can reinforce your commitment to sobriety and share your experiences with others who are on the same path.</p>
