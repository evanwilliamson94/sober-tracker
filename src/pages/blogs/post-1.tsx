        Maintaining sobriety after leaving rehab is challenging, but with the right tools and strategies, you can stay on track. Here are five practical tips to help you continue your recovery journey.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Build a Support System</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Surround yourself with people who support your sobriety. Whether itâ€™s friends, family, or a support group, having a strong network of positive influences is crucial for long-term recovery.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Develop New Habits</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Replace old habits with new, healthy ones. Engage in activities that help you grow, such as exercise, meditation, or learning a new hobby, to keep your mind and body busy.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Stay Connected with Therapy</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Continuing therapy after rehab is vital for addressing underlying issues that contributed to addiction. Therapists can help you work through emotional challenges and provide tools to maintain sobriety.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Avoid Triggers</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Identify the people, places, and situations that may tempt you to relapse and avoid them as much as possible. Create a plan for how to handle cravings when they arise.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Take it One Day at a Time</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Recovery is a journey. Focus on staying sober today rather than worrying about the future. Celebrate each day of sobriety as a victory.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg mb-4">By following these tips and staying committed to your recovery, you can build a healthy, sober life after rehab.</p>
