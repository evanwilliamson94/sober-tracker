          Addiction recovery is a lifelong journey that requires dedication, support, and personal growth.

          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            Independent living skills are vital for everyone, but they hold particular importance for those in recovery. These skills enable individuals to manage daily tasks like budgeting, organizing their home, and maintaining personal health. Often, these skills are lost during addiction, making it crucial to relearn or improve them in recovery.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Actionable Tips:</strong> Create a monthly budget, establish a daily routine, and commit to self-care habits like exercising and eating well. Utilize tools like <a href="https://mint.intuit.com/" target="_blank" className="text-teal-300">Mint</a> or <a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank" className="text-teal-300">Notion</a> to keep track of your goals and progress.

          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            Emotional regulation is often one of the biggest challenges in recovery. Those recovering from addiction need to learn how to control emotional responses and deal with stress, frustration, and sadness in a healthy way, without turning to substances.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Actionable Tips:</strong> Practice mindfulness, meditation, and journaling to help recognize and regulate emotional responses. Engaging in therapy can also provide guidance on managing emotional triggers in healthier ways.
